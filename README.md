### As space has no gravity, pens won’t work.
#### Normal pens work by gravity pulling the ink towards the pen’s nib (the writing part) – as you hold the pen in your hand writing part facing downwards.
#### As there’s no gravity in space, the ink doesn’t get pulled to the nib. However, special pens have been made that work in zero gravity.
